# SQL_JoiningMultipleTables

This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy. All the projects is from the "Joining Multiple Tables" course.

## Project 1: Lyft Trip Data
Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:
•	trips: trips information
•	riders: user data
•	cars: autonomous cars
The preview of the table is as below.

## Project 2: Welp
To practice what you’ve learned about joining multiple tables, you are going to use data from an exciting app called Welp. Users love Welp because it allows them to leave reviews of businesses in their city and see how other people reviewed the businesses.
For this project, you will be working with two tables:
•	places
•	reviews
The preview of the table is as below.

## Project 3: Reddit
For this project, you’ll be working as a Data Analyst who will be examining some fictional data from Reddit, a social news aggregation, content rating site.
On Reddit, users can create posts with content such as text, media, and links to other websites. Users can post content to different communities known as subreddits, which focus on a particular topic. Users can then rate others’ content by upvoting or downvoting them, and each post will show its total cumulative score.
For this task you were given three tables:
•	users: users data
•	posts: posts information
•	subreddits: information about subreddits
The preview of the table is as below.

## Project 4: VR Startup Company
Codecademy Virtual Reality (CVR), Inc. is the latest startup on the VR scene. As head of the Project Completion team, you have been given a list of upcoming projects needing to be delivered. Your main responsibility is to analyze our current talent pool to ensure each project can be completed efficiently and effectively.
Each project needs a Project Manager, Team Lead, Designer, Database Administrator (DBA), and at least two Developers.
