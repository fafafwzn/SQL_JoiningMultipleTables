# SQL_JoiningMultipleTables

This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy. All the projects is from the "Joining Multiple Tables" course.

## Project 1: Lyft Trip Data
Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:
•	trips: trips information
•	riders: user data
•	cars: autonomous cars
The preview of the table is as below.

## Project 2: Welp
To practice what you’ve learned about joining multiple tables, you are going to use data from an exciting app called Welp. Users love Welp because it allows them to leave reviews of businesses in their city and see how other people reviewed the businesses.
For this project, you will be working with two tables:
•	places
•	reviews
The preview of the table is as below.
