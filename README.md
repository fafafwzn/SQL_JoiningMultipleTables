# SQL_JoiningMultipleTables

This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy. All the projects is from the "Joining Multiple Tables" course.

## Project 1: Lyft Trip Data
Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:
•	trips: trips information
•	riders: user data
•	cars: autonomous cars
The preview of the table is as below.
