Let’s see what these tables contain by running the following commands:
SELECT * 
FROM places;
 
SELECT * 
FROM reviews;

2.
If each dollar sign ($) represents $10, how could you find all places that cost $20 or less?

3.
What columns can be used to JOIN these two tables?

Joining the tables
4.
Let’s explore how the places on Welp stand up to reviewers.
Write a query to do an INNER JOIN on the two tables to show all reviews for restaurants that have at least one review.

5.
You probably noticed all the extra information in your results.
Modify your previous query to select only the most important columns in order to display a log of reviews by selecting the following:
•	From the places table: name, average_rating
•	From the reviews table: username, rating, review_date, note

6.
Now write a query to do a LEFT JOIN on the tables, selecting the same columns as the previous question.
How are the results of this query different? Would this or the INNER JOIN be more useful for a log of reviews?

7.
What about the places without reviews in our dataset?
Write a query to find all the ids of places that currently do not have any reviews in our reviews table.

Bonus Questions
8.
Sometimes on Welp, there are some old reviews that aren’t useful anymore.
Write a query using the WITH clause to select all the reviews that happened in 2020. JOIN the places to your WITH query to see a log of all reviews from 2020.
(This will use the WITH clause as well as the strftime() function. See if you can use Google to dig up some information about the function before take a look at the hint.)

9.
Businesses want to be on the lookout for …ahem… difficult reviewers. Write a query that finds the reviewer with the most reviews that are BELOW the average rating for places.
